# Superstore Sales Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Superstore** sales dataset (sourced from Kaggle) to uncover key insights about sales, profits, and business performance across regions, categories, and time. Using Microsoft Excel, I built pivot tables, charts, and an interactive dashboard to answer real-world business questions and visualize trends.
